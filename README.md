##Support Vector Machine (SVM):

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
In the code provided, we used a linear kernel SVM (kernel='linear'), which means the decision boundary is a straight line.
SVM aims to maximize the margin between the classes, making it robust to outliers.
It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.

##Random Forest:


Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.
It constructs multiple decision trees during training and combines them to improve the overall performance.
Each tree is built using a random subset of the features and a random subset of the training data (bootstrap aggregating or bagging).
Random Forest handles overfitting well due to its averaging effect from multiple trees.
It provides feature importance scores, which can be helpful in feature selection.
In summary, both SVM and Random Forest are popular classification algorithms, each with its strengths and weaknesses. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and for cases where the number of features is greater than the number of samples, while Random Forest is known for its robustness to overfitting and feature importance estimation.
